# Setup

# Help / Contact

If you need help setting this up, please reach out to me on my live stream: fb.gg/livesimmy
I love to talk shop and code live on stream.

If you aren't able to reach me on FB, then reach out on twitter.com/livesimmy

# Goal of this Script

The goal of this is to push your video to tumblr automatically.

An example of this is when I take an instant replay live on stream (fb.gg/livesimmy) it
takes the instant replay and pushes it to tumblr. Through IFTTT I push the video to twitter.

I also have my tumblr linked to another account and it will do a tweet based off of the random
string that the script generates. So two separate accounts get a post about the live stream
and the clip.

This is vitally useful to engage social media as a tool.

I 100% recommend utilizing social media as your friend to grow your channel!

Good luck streaming!


# Future Updates

This source will be updated as issues are identified.

# Next Steps

Screenshot to tumblr is the next goal. The code is primarily ready for it however it has not been tested
as it is currently hardcoded to upload an MP4. Screenshots are next on the list of to-do.
